        Playing around with a few different tags so I can really show off the inline and internal CSS!

    <p style="color:green;">
        I've only ever really used (very limited) external CSS prior to this class, so it was a little surprising that
        you can change the appearance of a page by adding CSS to the actual html. It makes sense after you think about
        it for a little bit, but still shocking to realize at first. I can't say I <em>like</em> this information, but I
        definitely know I can do it now. I also learned that you can set backup defaults for alternate text, just in
        case your ideal font isn't supported on someone's computer, which is fairly interesting as well.
