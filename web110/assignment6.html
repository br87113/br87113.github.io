        Activity 2: Review IP address settings for your local network
    </h2>
    <p>
        In this activity, I reviewed the IP address settings for my home wifi. 
        It looks like some of the links were a little broken, so I did some looking around in the Mac User Guide website until I found a page that discussed network settings. 
        Once I found the network settings menu, I was able to investigate the configurations that had been set up. 
        The second step of this activity, due to Mac software updates, was a little out of date: TCP/IP settings aren't in Advanced anymore, but in Details. 
        After that, I used ifconfig (and plenty of Googling to understand what the resulting readout actually meant) to look at my network settings. 
        All in all, this was a fairly interesting exercise. 
        This really helped clear up some of my confusion around IP addresses—specifically, their purpose, and why there's so many of them—quite a bit. 
        If I run into another network error in the future, I might know better how to understand it, if not solve it.

        Activity 4: Share a folder and connect to the shared folder
    </h2>
    <p>
        This activity had me share a folder from my computer and then connect to it from a different one, also on the network. 
        It was interesting; I've never really done this before, since I've grown up with Google services and email for transfers. 
        Being able to set up devices that can transfer files just by being on the same network does also explain a lot of the paranoia around sharing your wi-fi password, or setting up hotspots. 
        I can see how this would be generally particularly useful for groups that don't use Google services, or just anything you'd like to share without Google, Dropbox, or your email service crunching it. 
        I should try this a few times with different kinds of data in different sizes, just to see how the quality holds. 
        Very interesting.
