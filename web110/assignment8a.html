    <p>
        I learned that you can format a document by right clicking.
        Granted, it does make the overall document look less spaced out and therefore more cramped and difficult to
        read, but if it works by professional standards, it'll work by mine.
        This will save so much time.
        I also knew in theory that unordered lists could contain links, I know I've certainly seen it in practice on
        various websites, but it's very strange to see the code for it.
        As for what I learned from reading the Wikiversity page: I never really realized you could debug HTML the same
        way you could a program.
        It makes sense, but I never really thought about it; I guess the furthest I thought was trial and error with the
        visual aspects.
        An HTML validator will make debugging HTML go easier in the future, most likely.
