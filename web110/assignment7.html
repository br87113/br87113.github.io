    Activity Summary
  </h1>
  <h2>
    Activity 1: Complete the following tutorial
  </h2>
  <p>
    For this activity, I read the included articles on internet safety.
    The Tutorialspoint article briefly goes over IPsec, SSL, and various kinds of internet threats, with a focus on
    phishing emails and how to spot scams.
    This article supplements the learning from the email week quite well, reminding you how to check whether or not an
    email is being spoofed.
    The GCF articles cover a wider breadth of topics.
    One of the most useful ones discusses what to do if you do get a virus (get an antivirus, like Norton, run a system
    scan, and go from there).
    Some of the ways to secure your home wi-fi were new to me—I'd never really heard of MAC address filtering before.
    This really helped me understand better how to keep my internet browsing secure.

    Activity 3: Research password managers and multi-factor authentication
  </h2>
  <p>
    This activity had me research a variety of password managers, as well as set up MFA on a few of my accounts.
    Unfortunately, I'd already set up MFA on all the accounts I could have, so I just did a lot of research on password
    managers, especially since I'd been meaning to pick one up recently.
    I ended up focusing on Bitwarden specifically, since I'd never really heard of it before and was wondering how a
    password manager being open-source could be a good thing.
    Bitwarden is a free, cloud-based, open-source password manager that allows you to sync across various devices,
    though it does paywall password hygiene options and has problems filling in forms smoothly.
    As it turns out, Bitwarden being open-source means it undergoes rigorous audits and evaluations by a variety of
    independent parties, thereby reinforcing its security.
    I ended up going with Bitwarden as my password manager, because I'm a college student and free things are very
    helpful in my day-to-day life, and Bitwarden's pros outweighed its cons.
