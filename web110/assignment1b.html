    Activity 5: IP Addresses and Geolocation
  </h2>
  <p>
    I decided to do activity 5.
    For activity 5, I read a website article posted by lifewire.com, "How to Fake a GPS Location on Your Phone."
    This article spoke about different apps available for Android devices, and desktop applications for spoofing a
    location on iPhone.
    It was a fairly short article, then followed up by using a website to locate my own IP address.
    I was able to see what my IP address says about my location (it places me roughly 25 miles from my location) and I'm
    not really certain what to do with that information.
    It told me a whole lot of other stuff that I also don't know what to do with, like the coordinates of the IP address
    location, hostname, and metro code, which I'm not familiar with.
    I learned that IP addresses are less accurate at determining location than I previously thought,
    and that there are Windows programs that can directly interfere with the GPS system on an iPhone, which I didn't
    previously know was possible.
