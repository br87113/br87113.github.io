  <h2>
    Activity 1 - #4. Configure Browser Settings
  </h2>
  <p>
    I went through my settings on Firefox and found there were a few settings that I hadn't changed from when I first
    installed the browser on this computer.
    On my desktop, which I got more recently, I went through and changed a bunch of settings, but I guess I never went
    and did that on my laptop.
    Nowadays, I tend to make a habit of going into the settings on every new device or program that I use, and tweaking
    things to fit my needs, so it was good to finally get around to that on this device.

  <h2>
    Activity 2 - #5. Configure Browser Extensions and Add-ons
  </h2>
  <p>
    Similarly to the above activity of configuring my browser settings, I decided to go through and cull some of my
    browser extensions.
    I found that I had a few extensions I had disabled, but not removed, so I went and removed those, which made my
    taskbar a little less cluttered.
    I also found a few new extensions to install, such as a specialized adblocker just for Hulu with ads, that removes
    them for me.
