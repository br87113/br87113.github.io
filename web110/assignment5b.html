    Activity 1: Complete the following tutorial
  </h2>
  <p>
    Like the last tutorial, this one seemed to be more of a summary article than a tutorial, this time for internet
    services.
    According to the page, there's four kinds of internet services: communication, information retrieval, web services,
    and World Wide Web.
    Communication breaks down into multiple different methods of electronic communication, such as email, instant
    messaging, forums, and mailing lists (to name a few).
    Information retrieval services (different from search engines) allow users to track down files.
    Web services connect applications to each other for ease of interaction, and the World Wide Web, or W3, allows for
    the connection and access of multiple spread out servers.
    In this activity, I learned that there's multiple kinds of internet services, with specific functions.
