      Activity 2: Compare search engines
    </h2>
    <p>
        For this activity, I compared multiple search engines to see which were the easiest and most effective to use. Google and Yahoo were the cleanest user interfaces, with Bing in third and Ask last. 
        Bing and Ask both provided multiple articles and pictures to look at, which tended to be more distracting than helpful, while Google and Yahoo were very minimalist and to the point. 
        This suggests that Google and Yahoo seem to be more confident in their ability to function as search engines, while Bing and Ask were potentially compensating for weaker performance.

        After this, I used Google to search for Google's market share. 
        Unsurprisingly, they had a 90.15% global search engine market share. 
        I learned just how dominant in the search engine market Google was. 
        Prior to this, I had an assumption that Google was beating its competitors, but lacked the exact extent. 
        I'll continue using Google as a search engine, seeing how well they perform and are funded compared to their competitors.

      Activity 4: Learn about Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
    </h2>
    <p>
      Similarly to the above activity of configuring my browser settings, I decided to go through and cull some of my browser extensions. 
      I found that I had a few extensions I had disabled, but not removed, so I went and removed those, which made my taskbar a little less cluttered. 
      I also found a few new extensions to install, such as a specialized adblocker just for Hulu with ads, that removes them for me.
