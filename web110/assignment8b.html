    <h2>
        Activity 1: Review Mozilla: What is accessibility?
    </h2>
    <p>
        I read the Mozilla article on accessibility for this activity, and I can safely say I had no idea there were
        such thorough standards on internet accessibility. I actually went on a little bit of a research rabbit hole to
        try and figure out what accessibility laws actually looked like in our state (when it came to technology and
        websites). From my very preliminary research, it seems like the accessibility guidelines only generally tend to
        apply to Illinois government agencies or universities, but they are *very* thorough guidelines. I was very close
        to going through the websites of various public universities just to see how well they held up to the guidelines
        before I actually looked at the guidelines and discovered how long they were. However, I have a significantly
        better understanding of federal requirements for accessibility standards, and if I make a website independently,
        I'll try and adhere to at least some of the concepts presented.

        Activity 2: Validate and, if necessary, correct a webpage using the W3C Markup Validation service
    </h2>
    <p>
        In this activity, I validated several of my course assignment webpages; I didn't get anything to change, which
        wasn't particularly surprising, considering how there aren't very many ways you can mess HTML up so bad it gets
        flagged in a debugger. I did try and break the page a little, just to see what would happen if something
        <em>did</em> get messed up, but nothing i managed to do actually registered as something to correct. It did get
        me wondering what it would take to create a website that would get flagged, HTML-wise, by the W3C Markup
        Validation service.
