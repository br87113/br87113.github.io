    Activity Summary
  </h1>
  <h2>
    Activity 1: Complete the following tutorial
  </h2>
  <p>
    This activity, interestingly enough, did not include a tutorial; it was an introductory summary page to the concept
    of social media and various social media sites.
    The site gave brief service descriptions of a selection of social media sites, with an interesting mix of US-based
    and UK-based.
    Some of the US descriptions are out of date: namely, X is referred to as Twitter, and Meta as Facebook.
    The lack of modernity is also displayed in its omission of several currently popular social media sites, such as
    Instagram, Reddit, or Tumblr.
    The activity then went on to ask us to decide which of the following sites were of interest.
    As someone in Gen Z, I've had an X account since before it became X.
    It is very easily my favorite, of the multiple listed.
    Unfortunately, due to how dated this site is, there isn't very much that is particularly actionable in the future
    just based off the information in this article, but I suppose it counts that I'm currently active on X (formerly
    Twitter).

  <h2>
    Activity 3: Review Smart Insights: The Honeycomb Model
  </h2>
  <p>
    For this activity, we were directed to read through an article about the honeycomb model of social media engagement.
    It's interesting to read through a cohesive account of this theory!
    I, as many other social media users likely have, have seen bits and pieces of this theory, generally when discussing
    the concepts of "ragebait" and the constant social media scroll.
    I've never encountered it broken down as a concept for marketing a digital presenceâ€”despite this, it's fairly easy
    to recognize when thinking through a variety of corporate social media accounts (see: Wendy's Twitter accounts).
    There are some ethical questions about how business should handle advertising; I think reading this article has
    helped solidify some of my positions and opinions on such practices, as well as given me tools to more accurately
    understand and break down how businesses interact on social media.
